## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

| Criterion | 40- | 40+ | 50+ | 60+ | 70+ | 
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.1       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 1.2       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 2.1       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 2.2       |     |     |     |  o  |     |
| 3.1       |     |     |     |  o  |     |  

I do think my assignment does a good job to relate existential risks with things that are related to my nationality but also most of the possible readers. This actually enables me to have a better understanding of the topic and proceed to investigate for more complicated issues of the topic. Examples and references are sufficient in my opinion and with good images are used to make the style be more professional. Both statistics and philosophical representation are used to explain more serious of the matter is and ensuring more readers can easier to understand the topic and content. The sentence structures are undestandable and relatively easy to understand but still keep them in a more professional manner.

However, time constraint is a challenging part of this assignment as I have less time than I expected. Therefore, some arguments lack strong supports and many of the writings are like puzzles that need to be reorganised. The image of recent news need to be translated or else it is completely useless as no anyone knows Chinese. The images I used are not consistent with the style of the writing like the image of cartoon computer wall but it is too late to find another image with same idea.

The introduction of this essay is well structured and informs the reader clearly the text is about China’s great firewall, specifically Hong Kong. The writer has also included a key word section which helps give us an overall idea of the topic. The website includes videos from trusted and well-known sources such as CNN to back their points surrounding the topic and help explain Chinas firewall situation and how the Chinese governments may be spying on users. The use of the case studies from the past and present help us as readers understand this topic further as we get more context, such as the mentions of Taobao being formed in 2003, a lot of readers may know little on this topic therefore including context like this makes it easier to understand. The discussion paragraph is crafted well as it is unbiased giving positive and negatives of the firewall and censorship within China. Overall, the points made are very clear and supported by many sources which are referenced well at the bottom of the page.

The writer has added a heading for a conclusion but has not yet added anything, i think adding a conclusion could be a good idea as it gives a clear overall summary of the topics discussed and allows the writer to state their own opinions. I think the title of the webpage may be slightly unclear and could be changed to “Will China’s internet influence diminish our way of life?” as it makes more grammatical sense. One of the photos used is of Facebook comments however it hasn't been translated to English which may not be clear for some readers.
