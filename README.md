- 2023-11-02 Review a few journals that related to my topic of Chinese culture, found out methods of China culture expansion such as Confucius Institute and found out Hong Kong adopted policy of biliteracy and trilingualism which are Chinese, English literature and Cantonese, Mandarin, English language. It seems Cantonese is still the first language so a different direction of research is needed. Possible approaches: Moral and National Education controversy, freedom of speech, government under pressure to speed up assimilation
